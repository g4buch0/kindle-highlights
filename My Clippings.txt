Capitalism has a number of useful features. Yet none of its shortcomings match its inability to accept natural abundance. Facing such conditions for resources – as with information, energy and labour – production for profit begins to malfunction. All of this can be explained by the fact capitalism emerged in a world fundamentally different to the one now coming into view. That meant it accepted a different set of presumptions – ones it took as permanent, but which were, in fact, contingent. Faced with a limitless, virtually free supply of anything, its internal logic starts to break down. That is because its central presumption is that scarcity will always exist.

In 1999 the music industry generated revenues worth some $14.6 billion in the United States, a figure which had fallen to $7.65 billion by 2016 – and that’s not accounting for inflation. In terms of how we conventionally understand GDP, those figures should signify disaster – reflecting how fewer people are listening to their favourite musicians than before. Except the opposite is true. Extreme supply in information goods – of which music is a paradigmatic example – means more people are listening to more music than ever, it’s just failing to show up in the numbers we think matter most.

In therapy, you need to be analytical, in part, to ensure what we call “containment,” or not letting a session get so emotional that it stops the therapeutic process or that you take those raw emotions with you when you leave. I know, in movie scenes, therapeutic breakthroughs come when a patient has a sudden revelation in session and then starts crying, acting out, and so forth. In real life, therapy is more helpful when it’s an intellectual process. (It’s called “emotional intelligence” for a reason.) Later on, during off-peak times, you can reflect on the conversation and make insightful connections and be as emotional about what you’ve figured out as you like. Share the revelations you have during off-peak times with your therapist during on-peak times.

In 1926, British psychologist Graham Wallas broke the creative process down into four distinct stages: • Preparation. The groundwork of creativity, when you research or outline broad-stroke concepts or ideas. • Incubation. The strange and mysterious period when you don’t consciously think about the idea, and let your subconscious sort it out for you. • Illumination. The sudden insight of creativity, when you get a flash of brilliance—the lightbulb moment. • Verification. The refinement period, when you confirm that your brilliant insight actually makes sense. The incubation period can be long— a night’s sleep, a day, a week, a year. Or it can be short. Even breaks of five minutes—the length of time between stepping in the bath and… “eureka!”—

Ethnographic research, where we talk with and observe real people in their “native habitat,” helps us to develop a rich understanding of current prob- lems and unmet needs such that we can create solid theories that will guide our efforts moving forward. In addition, it activates our empathy and provides needed inspiration for our creativity.

The emotions of the people we serve matter. They affect the tra- jectory of their path forward. Not just the emotion of the people we serve, but our emotion as wel . We need to al ow ourselves to feel. Emotion moves us beyond cognitive knowing to visceral knowing—that gut feeling we get inspires our curiosity, powers our imagination, enhances our wisdom, leads us to take action, and motivates us to persevere.

We can formulate a “hierarchy of needs” based on research insights to focus our experiential efforts and measure our performance. For example: Trustworthy—I got the information and utility I needed at every touchpoint I needed it; Easy—This company, product, or service is easy to do business with; Kind—I felt like they were considering my needs and that I was treated wel ; Meaningful—It was meaningful to my life, I achieved a greater outcome or received an unanticipated benefit; Very Cool—Wow, that was actual y very cool.

seemingly benign elements of the interface can quickly make someone sad . Another good practice when using user-generated content is to take advantage of all the information available to determine if it’s sensitive or not . For example, Facebook could have used a picture’s comments to determine if it represented a sad memory . If words like “sad,” “sorry,” “RIP,” or similar were found in the comments, the image could have been excluded from the Year in Review to avoid becoming a trigger of negative memories .

We need to be mindful of the harsh reality that users can act badly . It is our responsibility to design for this and protect the people using our products . How do we design to prevent abuse? Designing to mitigate abuse is never intuitive . This is the same reason why technology security is never perfect . Our job is to think about this when we design our prod- ucts . Here are some good questions to get us most of the way there . They should be asked when designing any new or enhanced feature: • How might people abuse this feature to hurt others? • If this feature is being used for abuse, how can a user take action against it? • Is the banning system top down or bottom up? If it’s top down, can it scale? • What are the consequences of someone abusing others? What do they have to lose? • If we add more safeguards, do they distract or discourage interac- tion from the rest of the users? If so, is there a way to do so without distraction? • Are there any incentives for someone to abuse?

Key Takeaways 1. User-centered design (UCD) is effective because it encourages us to study, research, and really understand the users before design- ing anything . Only once we know their needs and motivations can we come up with a product for them . Designing a product and then hoping that the users will have needs that correspond to our features just doesn’t work, and quite frankly is counterproductive . 2. When we create a feature meant to celebrate, present a memory, remind of a date, guess a need, etc ., we have to make sure that the users can opt out of it . By not doing so, we might force a hurtful reminder on our users . 3. Avoid confusing a change of emotion with a change of state in a database .

1. User-centered design (UCD) is effective because it encourages us to study, research, and really understand the users before design- ing anything . Only once we know their needs and motivations can we come up with a product for them . Designing a product and then hoping that the users will have needs that correspond to our features just doesn’t work, and quite frankly is counterproductive . 2. When we create a feature meant to celebrate, present a memory, remind of a date, guess a need, etc ., we have to make sure that the users can opt out of it . By not doing so, we might force a hurtful reminder on our users . 3. Avoid confusing a change of emotion with a change of state in a database . We shouldn’t associate the word used on the button to the actual user’s emotional state . Don’t underestimate the power of symbols linked to actions . These smileys, thumbs, likes, stars, and hearts carry a great load of emotion . 4.

Humility does not require us to reduce our point of view to a speck of dust, but it does mean being open to being wrong, and doing the very hard work of trying to understand others’ perspectives. Though we may still ultimately disagree with our conversation partner—and even voice this disagreement—humility protects us from reacting prematurely.

To gain insight into how our conversation partner feels in the moment, there are three important elements to observe while listening: body language (nonverbal, gestural cues), word choice (the language we use), and voice and tone (tenor, pitch, cadence). Since each of these cues gives us information about what is happening for the other person at an emotional level, I call these emotion indicators.

Para tener acceso a la magia contenida en el hemisferio derecho y favorecer que los dos sistemas operativos, el del hemisferio cerebral izquierdo y el del hemisferio cerebral derecho, se integren, es necesario: 1. Reconectar con el cuerpo y con aquellos elementos del inconsciente que están en relación con él. 2. Renunciar a la utopía del querer controlar un proceso que se escapa por completo a los límites estrechos de la razón. 3. Trabajar la contemplación; es decir, el saber mantenerse en silencio, en una actitud abierta y receptiva ante lo que puede surgir, ante lo que puede manifestarse, dejándonos sorprender. 4. Evitar juzgar lo que sucede como bueno o malo. Hay cosas que superficialmente pueden parecernos de una manera y ser algo muy distinto en el fondo. 5. Desarrollar la empatía, ese abrirnos a escuchar para conocer y comprender en lugar de juzgar. 6. Mantener un espíritu curioso e interesado

Quien no se valora mucho, tampoco se siente merecedor de que le pasen cosas buenas. Por eso se dan casos en los que si uno de los progenitores fue alcohólico y violento, puede buscarse de manera inconsciente personas parecidas porque en ese entorno familiar quiere ver si puede reescribir su historia.

Work provides us with a sense of purpose and can offer instant gratification in the form of praise, raises, and promotions. But the more we tie who we are to what we do, the more we emotionally attach to our jobs. We put constant pressure on ourselves to always be our best and then feel exhausted when we fail to live up to this unrealistic standard. And when we depend on our bosses for validation, the smallest bit of critical feedback starts to feel like a rejection of our entire selves.

In practice, the capitalist economy itself disproves the assumptions about intellectual property fomenting innovation.

An essential part of an anarchist revolution is global solidarity. Solidarity is the polar opposite of charity. It does not depend on an inequality between giver and receiver. Like all good things in life, solidarity is shared, thus it destroys the categories of giver and receiver and neither ignores nor validates whatever unequal power dynamics may exist between the two.

A truly liberating ethos is not just a new set of values, but a new approach to the relationship between the individual and her culture; it requires that people shift from being passive recipients of culture to participants in its creation and reinterpretation.

Nor can the leadership merely ‘implant’ in the oppressed a belief in freedom, thus thinking to win their trust. The correct method lies in dialogue. The conviction of the oppressed that they must fight for their liberation is not a gift bestowed by the revolutionary leadership, but the result of their own conscientization.

To investigate the generative theme is to investigate man’s thinking about reality and man’s action upon reality, which is his praxis. For precisely this reason, the methodology proposed requires the investigators and the people (who would normally be considered objects of that investigation) to act as co-investigators. The more active an attitude men take in regard to the exploration of their thematics, the more they deepen their critical awareness of reality, and in spelling out those thematics, take possession of that reality.

the investigation of thematics involves the investi-gation of the people’s thinking - thinking which occurs only in and among men seeking out reality together. I cannot think for others or without others, nor can others think for me. Even if the people’s thinking is superstitious or naive, it is only as they rethink their assumptions in action that they can change. Producing and acting upon their own ideas - not absorbing those of others - must constitute that process.

the programme content of the problem-posing method - dialogical par excel-lence - is constituted and organized by the students’ view of the world, where their own generative themes are found. The content thus constantly expands and renews itself. The task of the dialogical teacher in an interdisciplinary team working on the thematic universe revealed by their investigation is to ‘represent’ that universe to the people from whom he first received , it and ‘represent’ it not as a lecture, but as a problem.

Individuals, who were submerged in reality, merely feeling their needs, emerge from reality and perceive the causes of their needs.

The theory of anti-dialogical action has one last fundamental characteristic: cultural invasion, which like divisive tactics and manipulation also serves the ends of conquest. In this phenomenon, the invaders penetrate the cultural context of another group, and ignoring the potential of the latter, they impose their own view of the world upon those they invade and inhibit the creativity of the invaded by curbing their expression.
